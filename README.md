This program calculates the age solving the problem of the Leap Years for the birthday count.
Calculating the age by counting the days from the birthday is incorrect; the correct way to calculate 
is substracting the birth year from the current year and then subtract one more year 
if the current month/day comes before the user's birth month/day.
